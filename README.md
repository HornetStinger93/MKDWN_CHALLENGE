# This is my markdown challenge page.
## Overall what I am ~~putting here~~ is ~~mainly doesn't really matter~~ too much.
### Idea:
  What I plan to put here is just a bunch of random stuff on my computer out of context. I really don't have anything concrete I'd like ot share so I'll just post whatever.
