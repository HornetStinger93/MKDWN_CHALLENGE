# Here I will post some excerpts from past writings I have done for classes.
## Will they have a context **NO**, does that matter *maybe*???


This is from my Social Theories class last semester 
> Elasticity, in terms of consumers, can be thought of as how many alternative products does the consumer have access to them. So letâ€™s take chips for example. There are many varieties of chips available and because of this consumers can make substitutions if one chip company decides to increase their prices. So if lays increase the price of BBQ Chips consumers can substitute Lays for Pringles. This means there is a relatively high elasticity of demand in the market for chips. If we look at gasoline this would be relatively inelastic, as consumers do not have many alternatives to gasoline.
